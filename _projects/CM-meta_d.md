- I wrote stan codes for Bayesian estimation of metacognitive efficiency (meta-d') from confidence ratings. Two versions are available: non-hierarchical & hierarchical Bayesian estimation.

- Codes: [Github repo](https://github.com/HeesunPark26/Meta-d_STAN)

- You can find the details about meta-d' which is estimated by Type 2 signal detection theory model in the following paper: [Brian Maniscalco & Hakwan Lau 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2011.09.021)

- The hierarchical version referred HMeta-d' toolbox from [Fleming 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/nc/nix007)
