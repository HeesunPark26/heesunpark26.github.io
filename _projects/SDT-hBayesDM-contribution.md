- hBayesDM (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks) is a user-friendly package that offers hierarchical Bayesian analysis of various computational models on an array of decision-making tasks. The source code is available at [hBayesDM Github](https://github.com/CCS-Lab/hBayesDM)

- I wrote Stan codes and R and python wrapper to add Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model to hBayesDM (R package for hierarchical Bayesian Analysis)

- Codes: The main stan code of SDT model in hBayesDM [here](https://github.com/CCS-Lab/hBayesDM/blob/develop/commons/stan_files/task2AFC_sdt.stan)
