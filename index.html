<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I am a M.A student studying cognitive psychology at Seoul National University. I am broadly interested in understanding neural mechanisms underlying decision making and applying computational modeling to cognitive psychology research. With neuroscientific and computational approaches, I hope to understand the relationship between decision making and decision confidence (metacognition).
