# About Me
I am a M.A student studying cognitive psychology at Seoul National University. I am broadly interested in understanding neural mechanisms underlying decision making and applying computational modeling to cognitive psychology research. With neuroscientific and computational approaches, I hope to understand the relationship between decision making and decision confidence (metacognition).

- Metacognition
- Neuroimaging

# Education
- M.A., Cognitive Psychology (Mar, 2020 - Current) @ Seoul National University
